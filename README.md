# Matplotlib_Challenge
Use matplotlib to generate plots describing different information about a pre-clinical trial for cancer drugs in mice. Use pandas to filter and sort the data to create various graphs that describe the most promising treatments in a mock clinical trial. 

**Table of Summary Statistics for Each Treatment**

**Observations**

- Capomulin and Ramicane have the greatest rate of tumor recession out of the treatments in the trial. 
- Ceftamin isn't as effective but has a lower variance in tumor size at the end of treatment. 
- Tumor volume is positively correlated with mouse weight.
